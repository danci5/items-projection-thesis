_Abstract_:
This thesis studies the problematics of item similarities in educational systems and visualization of these items based on their similarities. First, we describe various measures that use learners’ performance data or text of the items for computation of the similarities. Second, we evaluate these measures mainly using results from clustering and visualization techniques, where the computed similarities are used as input. Then, we compare and study two different techniques used for data projection, which can provide us valuable insights into the data of the systems. The measures and the visualization techniques are evaluated on the data from the system Umíme česky. The results show that t-SNE is a good technique for projection of data and that the appropriate choice of similarity measure is crucial.
