perplexity-*-impact 		– visualizations showing impact of perplexity
pca-* 				– visualizations of (only) labeled items
tsne-vs-pca-* 			– visualizations that show the differences in performance of TSNE and PCA
hierarchicalclustering-* 	– 2 dendrograms
randindex-barplot 		– barplot that shows randindex values – performance of measures on labeled items (hierarchical clustering was used)
plotly-vyjmenovanaslovaB-*	– sample visualizations by plotly, which give us the ability to interact
tsne-vyjmenovanaslovaB-*	– matplotlib scatter plots of the plotly visualizations
counts-*			– counts of answers

Euclidean distance was used in all included visualizations as the second level similarity. It gives us overall better results.
